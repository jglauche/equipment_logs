Inspection

The TAZ3 was visually inspected after sitting offline for about 6 years.

- overall looks to be in good shape
- carbon plate installed as in the TAZ4.
- carbon plate has ABS slurry stuck on top, needs to be cleaned with Acetone
- X axis didn't move smoothly. Guide rods need to be cleaned and oiled
- Y axis moves smoothly
- Z endstop looks a bit sketchy, was glued in place using epoxy kitt. Likely to accept a lower hotend height
- Z axis is untested, using M5 threaded rods. Might want to be upgraded to spindles if it causes problems
- X, Y, Z min endstops seem to work
- spool holder didn't want to retract at first, lots of resistance. Moved more smoothly afterwards
- power supply is an industrial power supply with a plastic front cover. Looks safe.
- Extruder is a 3mm filament MGS one. A bit of filament was stuck in, presumably ABS
- Hotend wasn't checked. Looked like the fan mount for a v4/v5 J-head
- nozzle size unknown.

Notable spares:
- a spare carbon plate was found (used in TAZ4).
- a lot of adhesive PEI sheets were found. Could try to use those on the glass plate instead of carbon fibre.


Idea dump:
- single board computer; maybe a raspi 1 with a custom print controller
- make a console based print host in rust? Want to have features like time-left based heatbed control, integrated spool manager, gpio buttons
- log files about print times, filament used, etc along with fault log
